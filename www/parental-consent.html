    <h1>PARENTAL CONSENT FORM I’M OK, MOM</h1>

    <p><strong>Children under the age of 13 are not permitted to use the “I’m OK, Mom” app (the “App”) without the written permission of the parent or legal guardian.</strong></p>

    <p>A parent or legal guardian (“you”) must sign and submit this form in order to add a child under the age of 13 as a Child in the App and allow the child to use the Services.</p>

    <p>Once you give your consent for the child to use the Services within the App, we will collect the following data regarding the child:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>nickname</strong> you provide the child with (please, use any nickname not associated with a name and surname of the child);</li>
        <li><strong>avatar photo</strong> if you decide to upload the one (please, use the photo not identifying the child);</li>
        <li><strong>location data</strong> including GPS, WiFi and mobile location (you can turn off the location services on your device at any time) to provide you with the Services;</li>
        <li><strong>cell phone number</strong> to enable the child to send SOS-SMS notices;</li>
        <li><strong>device usage statistics</strong> to display the child’s device battery level.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The information listed above will be disclosed to a person identified as a Parent in the App. In addition, the child will be able to send SOS-SMS notices to a Parent with whom they have the same account.</p>
    <p>Also, we share some personal information, including location data, collected from a child under 13 with our third-party providers and companies in the same corporate group, as specified in our <a href="#" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
    <p>We will not use or share the personal information of a person added as a Child within the App, including a child under the age of 13, to any third-party providers or partners for the advertising purposes.</p>
